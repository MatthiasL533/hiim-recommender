An intelligent recommender system that uses local LLM technology to recommend Human Initiatives Impact Measurement (HIIM) Methods to companies based on their specific requirements and needs.

## Repository Contents

This repository consists of two main parts:

### 1. Replication Package (`Replicationpackage/`)

The replication package contains materials related to the development and testing of the recommender system:

- **`csv_impactmeasurement_repo.csv`**: A comprehensive CSV dataset containing information about various HIIM methods and frameworks, including metadata such as method names, developers, release years, descriptions, scope (ethical, social, environmental, economic), impact scores, and other relevant characteristics.

- **`Prompt prototype .txt`**: The prototype prompt template used for the LLM-based recommender system. This file contains the structured prompt that guides the AI to recommend appropriate HIIM frameworks based on company requirements.

- **`Prompt test cases.txt`**: Contains guidelines and an example for creating test cases. These test cases were used to evaluate the recommender's accuracy and effectiveness.

- **`Prototype responses, test cases and their evaluation.xlsx`**: An Excel file documenting the test cases, the actual responses generated by the recommender, and their evaluation metrics.

- **`Fishers exact test.R`**: R script for statistical analysis using Fisher's exact test to compare the recommender's performance with human recommendations.

- **`Wilcoxon test.R`**: R script implementing the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical validation of the recommender system.

- **`Replication`**: Additional replication materials or reference data.

- **`Readme.txt`**: Documentation specific to the replication package.

### 2. Main Artifact (The Recommender System)

The artifact is a Python-based recommender system that leverages local LLM technology (via Ollama) to provide intelligent HIIM framework recommendations.

**Core Components:**

- **`main.py`**: The main entry point for the CLI interface. Provides an interactive command-line interface for users to input company information and receive HIIM framework recommendations.

- **`src/recommender.py`**: The main recommender class that orchestrates the recommendation process.

- **`src/data_loader.py`**: Handles loading and processing of the HIIM methods CSV dataset. Formats the data for use as context in LLM prompts.

- **`src/llm_handler.py`**: Manages interactions with the Ollama LLM service. Builds structured prompts, sends requests to the LLM, and parses the JSON responses.

- **`data/csv_impactmeasurement_repo.csv`**: The HIIM methods dataset (identical to the one in the replication package).

## Prerequisites

Before running the artifact, ensure you have:

1. **Python 3.7 or higher** installed
2. **Ollama** installed and running:
   - Download from [https://ollama.ai/](https://ollama.ai/)
   - At least one compatible model pulled (e.g., `llama2:7b`, `gemma`, or `mistral`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/MatthiasL533/hiim-recommender>
cd hiim-recommender
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Verify Ollama installation:
```bash
ollama list
```

5. If no model is installed, pull a compatible model:
```bash
ollama pull llama2:7b
```

## Running the Artifact

### Basic Usage

Run the main script from the project root:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the following information about your company:

- **Company Name**: The name of your organization
- **Company Description**: A brief description of what your company does
- **Industry/Field**: The industry or field in which your company operates
- **Key Activities/Products**: Important activities or products that define your business
- **ESG Requirements**: Specific ESG requirements or reporting needs you have
- **Purpose/End Goal**: The ultimate purpose or goal you're trying to achieve with ESG reporting

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: The system loads HIIM methods data from the CSV file containing information about various reporting frameworks.

2. **Company Information Collection**: Users provide details about their company, industry, activities, ESG requirements, and goals.

3. **Context Preparation**: The data loader formats the HIIM methods into a structured context for the LLM.

4. **LLM Processing**: The LLM handler constructs a detailed prompt with company information and available frameworks, then sends it to Ollama.

5. **Recommendation Generation**: The LLM analyzes the company's needs against available frameworks and returns the top 3 recommendations with detailed justifications.

6. **Output Formatting**: The system formats the JSON response into a human-readable recommendation report.
