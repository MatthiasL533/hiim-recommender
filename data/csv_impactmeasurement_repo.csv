This helps guide the company to make informed decisions about whether or not to proceed the project, or to see if improvement is necessary. ;The B Impact Assessment can help companies develop a strategic vision that integrates social and environmental responsibility into their business model by identifying areas that need to be improved and setting goals for future performance. This way, companies can create an improved strategy/roadmap. This method also gathers data for operational purposes, namely data regarding environmental impacts to reduce this impact for future operations for instance, or data to increase energy efficiency. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wgk0LyXIs included, evidence is found in the method documentation.--2FeXTfS9uixb4AtXqJPjsz/view?usp=share_link ;"BIA provides a customized report with tangible recommendations on how companies can improve their impact across the Workers, Customers, Community, the Environment and Governance sections.

This includes the projects, plan and policies that are in place, their current and future investments and the products and/or services a company produces. Furthermore, the entire value chain of a company is of great importance to the assessment. The CGBS also puts great importance on the workplace, the working environment and the conditions of their suppliers, thus the impact and performance that their production sites and facilities have is also assessed. The ECG website does state that municipalities can apply the CGBS, however it is not to assess a city, but to assess certain companies of the city as a group or companies that are owned by the government.

The documentation states that companies that align their priorities with the SDGs can strengthen their employee engagement due to the SDGs reflecting stakeholder expectations. Furthermore, the SDGs compass encourages companies to incorporate the SDGs into their communication and reporting with their stakeholders. A company needs to first define its priorities and set goals. For example, by deciding to prioritize gender equality and deciding that by 20Is included, evidence is found in the method documentation.0 they want to have an equal amount of women and men working at their company. In addition, the SDG compass encourages companies to preliminary assess their current, potential, positive and negative impacts that their business activities have on the SDGs. This alone would already lead to insights for the internal stakeholders of a company as it would showcase where positive impact can be scaled up and negative impact can be reduced or removed. https://sdgcompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/019104_SDG_Compass_Guide_2015_v29.pdf p.11 


External 
Suppliers 
Companies can not focus on all 17 SDGs, so the SDG compass guide encourages them to prioritize and set goals. A company may decide to focus on goals more related to labor and so suppliers will become important and interested stakeholders. The SDGs can also be mapped against a company's value chain, of which suppliers are a component. Nevertheless, each SDG will have some relation to suppliers. 
For example, SDG6 Clean water and sanitation. ""Company identifies as a priority to reduce its negative impact on SDG 6 in its supply chain by working with suppliers to reduce its water consumption in water-stressed regions."" https://sdgcompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/019104_SDG_Compass_Guide_2015_v29.pdf 

It could also be useful and interesting for the suppliers to know which companies are working on aligning their business strategies with the SDGs, due to their heavy focus on human rights in general. 

General public 
""As the SDGs form the global agenda for thedevelopment of our societies, they will allow leading companies to demonstrate how their business helps to advance sustainable development, both by minimizing negative impacts and maximizing positive impacts on people and the planet. "" https://sdgcompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/019104_SDG_Compass_Guide_2015_v29.pdf p. 4 

As mentioned before, the SDGs are heavily focused on human rights, this directly involves millions of people around the world. With goals such as SDG1 End poverty, SDG4 quality education, and SDG2 Zero hunger a wide range of people is being addressed. The people affected and people that simply want to be involved would have a great interest in which companies are actively trying to change their impact for their benefit. Thus they would have a great interest in the report that would result out of using the SDG compass. 

The SDG compass also states governments and companies alone can only do so much, aid and support from the general public also is a must. The SDG compass encourages engagement in partnerships across the value chain within a sector, government or civil society organizations. https://sdgcompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/019104_SDG_Compass_Guide_2015_v29.pdf p.5 

Regulators 
As mentioned before, the SDG compass encourages companies to start with a preliminary assessment and then proceed with the other steps, after which a report is made. The report will showcase how well a company's strategies are aligned with the SDGs. Governments worldwide have already agreed to these goals and the SDG compass calls for action among governments, businesses, and civil society. Companies could be working with companies to achieve that and thus would be interested in their report and how they have been doing so or in the past to, for example, decide whether they would like to work with them. 

Funders 
By using the SDG compass and thus getting closer to aligning ones strategy with the SDGs a company can attract funders to further implement and integrate changes. The report will showcase information on a company's sustainable development performances, goals, priorities, and indicators. 

Peers 
There is no mention in the documentation of end reports being shared with peers or any exchange between peers. However, the SDG compass provides a common language and framework of action that will help with the communication about impact and performance. Thus, companies can look at the reports of their peers if interested. In addition, the method also encourages partnerships between companies, which could lead to companies checking out one another's commitment and priorities to and for the SDGs. https://sdgcompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/019104_SDG_Compass_Guide_2015_v29.pdf p.24";No evidence, but we think it is not included.;Is included, evidence is found in the method documentation.;;"""The SDG Compass is developed with a focus on large multinational enterprises.

MIF;Measuring Impact Framework;World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD);2008;;The tool consists of a methodological guideline and an online assessment sheet. It is accessible online and free of charge;"The MIF helps companies measure and assess their societal contribution and use this understanding to inform operational and future investment decisions. It helps them evaluate where and how they can contribute to sustainable development in the countries they are operating in. It is also designed to: (i) underpin the business license to operate, (ii) improve the quality of stakeholder engagement, (iii) help to manage risks more effectively, and (iv) identify ways to enhance the business contribution to society. The tool allows for measuring both direct and indirect impacts and requires stakeholder involvement in determining the materiality of sustainability issues as well as in the evaluation of measurement results.
The framework is based on a four-step methodology that attempts to merge the business perspectives of its contribution to development with the societal perspectives of what is important where that business operates. Step one, set boundaries: determine the scope and depth of the overall assessment in terms of geographical boundary (local versus regional) and types of business activities to be assessed. Step two, measure direct and indirect impacts: Identify and measure the direct and indirect impacts arising from the corporation’s activities, mapping out what impacts are within the control of the corporation and what it can influence through its business activities. Step three, assess contribution to development. Assess to what extent the corporation’s impacts contribute to the devel- opment priorities in the assessment areas. Step four, prioritise management response: based on steps two and three extract the key risks and opportunities relative to the cor- poration’s societal impact, and based on this, develop an appropriate management response. There is no “one size fits all” way to use this methodology. In order to appro- priately tailor the methodology to the business and its operating context, as well as ensure follow-up actions are taken, corporations are encouraged to make the assessment as participative as possible, consulting people both within and if possible external to the corporation.

IWR;Impactwijzer;Partos & Goede Doelen Nederland in collaboration with Sinzer;2019;;Project assessment sheet tool (online);Impactwijzer is a method that aims to change the culture in organizations. The method is designed, not only to measure impact, but also to incorporate working in an impact oriented way in all parts of the organization. Impactwijzer describes this as a continuous process, in which everybody learns from previous foundings and decisions. Impact wijzer focuses on charities, but can also be used by NGOs or for-profit organizations.;No evidence, but we think it is not included.;Is included, evidence is found in the method documentation.;Is included, evidence is found in the method documentation.;No evidence is found in the method documentation, but it is likely that it is included.;No evidence, but we think it is not included.;Impact investment/investors/social return is never explicitly mentioned;The goal of Impactwijzer is create an impact oriented working environment in which every stakeholder associated to the organization is aware of the impacts resulting from their decision. Indicators and other artefacts (e.g. Dashboard) that are deliverables resulting from this method, enable stakeholders to consider the consequences (e.g. impact) of their decisions. As such, Impactwijzer can be used for day-to-day decisionmaking, but also for monitoring and management. These practices all relate to management.;"Reporting is an important part of the Impactwijzer method. Impact reports consist of a collection of indicators that are deemed relevant for the audiciene of the report. It is explicitly noted that a report can be designed for a particular group of stakeholders (e.g. investors, suppliers, employees) (Module ""Reporting and learning"").";"The Impactwijzer stimulates evaluation on results to make strategic changes and maximize the positive impact. The evaluation is likely on ongoing activities, but can also be on finished activities (Module ""Learning and reporting"").";As far as we know, using Impact Wijzer is not required for certification by any issuer. Acquiring certification or any other formal, external recognition is also not prescribed by Impact Wijzer.;There is no intended audicience defined in the method documentation.

By pursuing this culture, the goal is also to maximize social impact. Through processes such as reporting and evaluation, the boundaries of maximal social impact are constantly stretched. In this way, maximum social impact is never achieved, but it is always pursued.

It is important to identify what may need to change within the investment management process so that you are able to maximise social impact. That is why Managing Impact is the core of the impact measurement process (p.16).;"The final step in the impact measurement process involves monitoring – tracking progress against (or deviation from) the objectives defined in the first step and made concrete through the indicators set in the third step; and reporting – transforming data into present- able formats that are relevant for key stakeholders. Monitoring and reporting are iterative processes that go hand in hand because what is monitoring to one stakeholder is reporting to another e.g. when a VPO/SI is monitoring the progress of an investee SPO, that SPO is reporting relevant data to the VPO/SI (p.24).";There are multiple purposes described for EVPA, evaluation of completed activities is not one of them.;No mention or prescription of certification in EVPA.;Internal & external stakeholders (p. 25);p.Is included, evidence is found in the method documentation.9 grants a summary of some of the Target Audiences based on the motivations for using the method.;Is included, evidence is found in the method documentation.;No evidence, but we think it is not included.;"The goal of impact measurement is to manage and control the process of creating social impact in order to maximise or optimise it (relative to costs)(p.16).

It is implicit that social and biophysical impacts (and the human and biophysical environments) are interconnected. The overall purpose of all impact assessment is to bring about a more sustainable world, and that issues of social sustainability and ecological sustainability need to be considered in partnership. SIA is also understood to be an umbrella or overarching framework that embodies all human impacts including aesthetic impacts (landscape analysis), archaeological (heritage) impacts, community impacts, cultural impacts, demographic impacts, development impacts, economic and fiscal impacts, gender assessment, health impacts, indigenous rights, infrastructural impacts, institutional impacts, political impacts (human rights, governance, democratisation etc), poverty assessment, psychological impacts, resource issues (access and ownership of resources), tourism impacts, and other impacts on societies.

These different levels are affected in different ways by an impact or impact- causing action. 
Because ‘social impact’ is conceived as being anything linked to a project that affects or concerns any impacted stakeholder group, almost anything can potentially be a social impact so long as it is valued by or important to a specific group of people. Environmental impacts, for example, can also be social impacts because people depend on the environment for their livelihoods and because people may have place attachment to the places where projects are being sited. Impacts on people’s health and wellbeing are social impacts. The loss of cultural heritage, important habitats or biodiversity can also be social impacts because these are valued by people.
